This document outlines the initial functional requirements for our platform, designed to connect and empower alumni. Users can 
create profiles with education, employment, skills, and interests. The alumni directory lets users search for fellow alumni based 
on criteria like graduation year and industry. Networking tools include connection requests, private messaging, and group chats.
Our platform also supports event creation and promotion, with an interactive calendar for RSVPs. A dedicated announcement section 
allows alumni to post opportunities. Our tech stack: PostgreSQL for the database, Spring Boot for the backend, and Angular for the frontend.
